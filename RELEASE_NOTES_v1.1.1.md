# Release Notes: v1.1.1

**Release Date**: October 30, 2025
**Type**: Patch Release (Critical Bug Fix)

---

## üêõ Critical Bug Fix: Startup Panic

This patch release fixes a **critical nil pointer dereference panic** that could prevent the controller from starting up successfully.

---

## What Was Fixed?

### Nil Pointer Dereference in Secret Queue Processor

**Issue**: The real-time secret watcher introduced in v1.1.0 contained a race condition that could cause a panic on startup:

```
panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
[signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation code=0x1 addr=0x0 pc=0x187e054]
goroutine 72 [running]:
github.com/supporttools/push-to-k8s/pkg/k8s.processDebouncedSecretQueue
```

**Root Cause**: The debounce timer was initialized as `nil` and could be dereferenced in a `select` statement before any events arrived to initialize it, specifically at `pkg/k8s/secret.go:453` when accessing `timer.C`.

**Fix**: Implemented a nil-safe channel pattern where the timer channel is conditionally set based on whether the timer is initialized. A nil channel in a `select` statement blocks forever (never selected), eliminating the race condition between timer initialization and select evaluation.

---

## Technical Details

### Changes

**File**: `pkg/k8s/secret.go`
- Added nil-safe channel pattern before the select statement
- Changed `case <-timer.C:` to `case <-timerC:` where `timerC` is conditionally set
- When timer is nil, timerC remains nil and never gets selected
- When timer is initialized, timerC is set to timer.C and becomes active

### Impact

- ‚úÖ **Eliminates startup panics** caused by the race condition
- ‚úÖ **No functional changes** to secret synchronization behavior
- ‚úÖ **No configuration changes** required
- ‚úÖ **Fully backward compatible** with v1.1.0

## Upgrade Instructions

### Helm Chart Upgrade

```bash
helm upgrade push-to-k8s supporttools/push-to-k8s \
  --version 1.1.1 \

---

## Who Should Upgrade?

**Priority**: HIGH

- ‚úÖ **Especially critical** if you've experienced startup panics or crashes
- ‚úÖ **Recommended for all deployments** to prevent potential issues
