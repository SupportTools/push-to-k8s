## üìù Project Description

### One-Line Description
> Automatically synchronize Kubernetes secrets across all namespaces with a single label

### Short Description (Tweet-sized)
> Push-to-K8s: Production-ready Kubernetes controller that syncs labeled secrets across all namespaces. Label once, propagate everywhere. Zero-config. #Kubernetes

### Full Description (Press Release)
> Push-to-K8s is an open-source Kubernetes controller that automatically synchronizes secrets from a source namespace to all other namespaces in a cluster. By simply labeling a secret with `push-to-k8s=source`, the controller ensures it's propagated and kept in sync across your entire cluster. Built for production use with comprehensive Prometheus metrics, health checks, and graceful shutdown handling. Perfect for distributing registry credentials, TLS certificates, API keys, and other cluster-wide secrets.
